Into the breach style roguelike tactics

small map, enemies show what they're going to do

fantasy style

instead of 1 attack 1 move, use action points (5 to start, move costs 2, attack costs 2, skills cost 1-5)

Items can increase action points for the turn

play around with characters taking all actions sequentially, or letting you choose each step like breach

maybe stick to party of 1-3, but with some items and skills benefiting you for using less units

structure like a DnD party
