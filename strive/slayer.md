## Combo:
### Things to Lab
* Find routing into meaty/safe masters hammer
* Lab a framekill to give perfect BSU/2K (Assuming startup is same or simmilar)
* Frame kills for dash safejumps
* Investigate c.S > f.S > BSU ( May be off of CH starter only, but it looks like f.S has forward movement specifically when cancelled off of c.S)
* Find optimal BSU frc route (The hit will immediately get the universe effect, so probably p.Dandy > Pilebunker or p.Dandy > It's Late
* What are the conditions for f.S stagger
* Universe 2P/5P into p.Dandy > Pilebunker/It's Late
* It's Late/Bump ahead RC

### Things to consider
* CH k.Mappa gives 5K > k.Mappa

## Pressure
### Things to lab
* Frame data on It's late and bump ahead
* Masters hammer 50/50s
* Pilebunker FastRC interactions
* Throw safejumps
* BSU safejumps
* f.S, 5H, 6H frame data
* Crossup Dandy fastRC BSU
* Which buttons frame trap into Dandy, P.Mappa
* 2P frame data


## Neutral:
### Things to lab
* Invuln on Dashes
* Invuln on k.Dandy
* Low Crush on Hammer
* Is backdash jump cancellable
* is 44 > 6S worth the meter
