## ITS ALL ABOUT THE FUCKEN NO LOOKS BABY
* The swaggiest (and possibly most optimal) slayer combo theory is all about No look Bunkers, any time you get a counter hit (or universe) on any H button, Universe 5D, or Hammer you can do it
the goal is always to bunker when you're basically right on top of the opponent in a way that puts you ahead of them with them sliding into your feet, allowing you to pick them back up with c.S into something (and usually doing a 2nd or 3rd bunker)

* Aside from the damage, swag, and DAMAGE from these routes, they will either end with a WB, or a midscreen bunker, which gives wk.Mappa oki into a 50/50 between 2K and BSU

### 2H
* Kind of the template for most no-look routes
CH 2H > p.Dandy > c.S > 2S > k.Dandy > Bunker > c.S > 2S > k.Dandy > Bunker > c.S > 2S > 2H > x.Dandy > Bunker

### 6H
* The whiffed mappa makes this the swaggiest
CH 6H > wp.Mappa > c.S > p.Dandy > Bunker > c.S > 2S > k.Dandy > Bunker > c.S > 2S > 2H > x.Dandy > Bunker

### 5H
* The highest damage route, the trick is to hit the 2H > p.Dandy as early as possible and delay the first bunker
CH 5H > p.Dandy > 2H > p.Dandy > Bunker > c.S > 2S > k.Dandy > Bunker > c.S > 2S > 2H > k.Dandy > Bunker




### It's Late
